Many developers, sooner or later, come to a point where they realize none of the existing tools can do exactly what they want. For example, the vendor of your favorite IDE hasn’t implemented a feature you’re using, or you’re working with a rather new custom framework that isn’t yet supported by your IDE. What to do? The good news is that IntelliJ IDEA and its plugins are not set in stone, so anyone – yes, that includes you – can implement support for a new language, library, or framework.

In this talk, Yuriy will tell you how all those who contribute to IntelliJ IDEA keep up with innovations in cyberspace, implementing IDE features for popular technologies.

Here you can find the following examples:

- Implicit usage provider
- Inspection
- Reference contributor
- Custom Language
- Integrated Web Content
